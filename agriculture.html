      <p>
        Food security and agriculture form the backbone of sustainable
        development in Africa, and ELPI’s focus on this pillar at the Inaugural
        Gala is crucial in highlighting the importance of resilient agricultural
        systems and equitable access to food. This aligns with Sustainable
        Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), which aims to "end hunger, achieve food
        security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
