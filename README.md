# Electoral-Leadership-Performance_Index

Good governance and effective service delivery at the
county level are pivotal to Kenya's socio-economic
development. The devolution of powers and resources to
counties, as enshrined in the 2010 Constitution, marked a
significant milestone in Kenya's journey toward more
accountable and responsive government.

This proposal outlines a comprehensive County
Government Performance Index (CGPI) study in Kenya, in
line with the growing demand for accountability and
transparency in the realm of devolved governance.

Kenya's 47 counties play a pivotal role in shaping the
everyday lives of its citizens. The CGPI study is designed to
gauge the efficiency, accountability, and service delivery
capabilities of these county governments, while also
ensuring that public participation remains at the heart of
the devolution process.

At elpi, we understand that good governance is
paramount to sustainable development, and the CGPI
study seeks to provide a roadmap for continuous
improvement.

By assessing the performance of county governments
across a range of indicators, it enables citizens,
policymakers, and other stakeholders to better
understand the strengths and weaknesses of
individual counties. This information empowers
county governments to enhance service delivery,
strengthen governance, and address the unique needs
and challenges of their respective constituencies.
The rest of this document therefore outlines our
approach, budget, and timeline for the CGPI study,
emphasizing the importance of transparency,
inclusivity, and public participation throughout the
project.
