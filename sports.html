      <h1>SPORTS AWARDS</h1>
      <p>
        The Sports pillar aligns with several United Nations Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being),
        SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 10 (Reduced
        Inequalities). By promoting sports, leaders contribute to these global
        objectives, helping to create a more equitable and sustainable future
        for all. The Gala will highlight the contributions of sports leaders to
        the SDGs, showcasing how sports can be a powerful vehicle for achieving
        broader development goals.
