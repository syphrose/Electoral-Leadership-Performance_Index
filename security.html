      <h1>SAFETY & SECURITY AWARDS</h1>
      <p>
        Safety and security are the bedrock of a stable society. Without them,
        development is stifled, investment is deterred, and the social fabric
        begins to fray. African leaders who prioritize safety and security
        ensure that their nations are protected from internal and external
        threats, ranging from crime and violence to terrorism and political
        instability. Recognizing these leaders highlights the essential role
        that safety and security play in achieving sustainable development and
        social harmony.

        <p>
          Safety and security are prerequisites for economic growth. Investors,
          both local and international, are more likely to commit resources to a
          country where the rule of law is upheld, and where people and property
          are protected.
