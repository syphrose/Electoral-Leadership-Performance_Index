      <h1>WASH AWARDS</h1>
      <p>
        Access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene practices is not
        only a basic human right but also a cornerstone of public health and
        economic development. Leaders who prioritize WASH initiatives are
        addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing communities
        across Africa, from reducing disease burdens to promoting gender
        equality and ensuring environmental sustainability. Recognizing
        leadership in WASH underscores the importance of these essential
        services in building healthy, resilient, and prosperous societies.
