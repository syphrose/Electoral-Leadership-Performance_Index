      <h1>BLUE ECONOMY AWARDS</h1>
      <p>
        The Blue Economy pillar is directly aligned with several United Nations
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 14 (Life Below
        Water), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 13 (Climate
        Action). By promoting sustainable use of marine resources, the Blue
        Economy contributes to global efforts to protect the ocean, promote
        economic prosperity, and combat climate change. The Gala will showcase
        how African leaders are advancing these global objectives through their
        commitment to the Blue Economy, positioning Africa as a leader in
        sustainable development.
