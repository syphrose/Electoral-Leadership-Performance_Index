        <h2>Addressing Structural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
          In many African countries, structural inequalities - based on income,
          gender, ethnicity, and access to resources - persist.

        <h2>Fostering Sustainable Economic Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Reduced inequality is directly tied to sustainable economic growth, a
          principle embodied in SDG 10.1, which seeks to achieve and sustain
          income growth for the bottom 40% of the population.

          nequality also manifests in the uneven distribution of resources and
          opportunities, particularly in healthcare, education, and political
          representation.
