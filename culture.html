      <h1>CULTURE AWARDS</h1>
      <p>
        The Arts and Culture pillar aligns with several United Nations
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 4 (Quality
        Education), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 16 (Peace,
        Justice, and Strong Institutions). By promoting and investing in the
        arts, leaders contribute to these global objectives, helping to create
        more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable societies. The Gala will
        showcase how the arts can be leveraged to achieve broader development
        goals, emphasizing the importance of cultural vitality in the pursuit of
        sustainable development.
